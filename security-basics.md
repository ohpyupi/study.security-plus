# Introduction to Security Terminologies
### Security Roles
* Custodian
  * Responsible for maintaining and protecting data based on security policies
* Data Owner
  * In charge of owning data assets. Typically executive roles.

### Types of Hackers
* White-hat hackers
  * Expose security flaws without malicious intent for the purpose of better security
* Black-hat hackers
  * Discover malicious security vulnerabilities for personal gain
* Gray-hat hackers
  * Discover security flaws and often make these known publicly but never for personal gain
* Script Kiddies
  * Download and run exploits created by others without having a full understanding of the exploits
  * Low level of technical sophistication
  * Lack of extensive resource/funding
* Penetration Testers
* Hacktivist
  * Use hacking to promote a political or ideological agenda

### Types of Threat Actor
* Organized crime
  * A threat actor type whose sole intent behind breaking into a computer system or network is monetary gain
* Competitor
  * Engages in illegal activities to get the know-how and gain market advantage
 
### OSINT (Open-source Intelligence)
* Data collected from publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context
* Purposes
  * Gaining advantage over competitors
  * Passive reconnaisance in penetration testing
  * Preparation before launching a cyberattack
  
### Penetration Testing
* Bypasses security controls
* Actively tests security controls
* Exploits vulnerabilities
* Pivoting
  * The practice of using one compromised system as a platform for further attacks on other systems on the same network

### Vulnerability Scanning
* Identifies lack of security controls
* Identifies common misconfigurations
* Passively tests security controls

### Types of Testing
* White-box Testing
* Black-box Testing
* Gray-box Testing
* A credentialed Scan
  * Provides a set of credentials for various systems
  
### Security Principles
* Least Privilege Principle
  * Design in a way that users have only the permissions they need to do their jobs
  * Opposite to Excessive Privileges
* Separation of Duties
  
### RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
* Groups disks together for the purpose of performance and data availability.
* RAID level 1 (Disk Mirroring)
  * Ensures that all disk writes on two disks in case on disk fails
  
### IoT (Internet of Things)
* Main vulnerabilities
  * Unable to update embedded firmware
  * Commonly shipped with default configuration including the username and password
* Examples
  * Watches, lightbulbs, UAVs, drones, internet cameras

### Misc.
* Banner
  * Describes a text message containing system information details after connecting to a service on a server
* Sandboxing
  * A mechanism for safe execution of untested code or untrusted applications
* Live Boot Media
  * Removable storage media that contains a portable, non-persistent OS
  * For examples, CD, DVD, or a USB drive
