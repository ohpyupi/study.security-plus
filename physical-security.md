# Physical Security
### Data Emanation
* The electromagnetic field generated by a network cable or network device, which can be manipulated to eavesdrop on conversations or to steal data
* Preventions
  * Use Faraday cage
  
### Tape backups
* Provides a copy of important data should server hard disks fail

### Cipher Lock
* Electronic keypads whereby authorized people enter an access code to get access to a room or a building

### PDS (Protected Distribution System)
* a US goverment term
* Dictates that cables should not be easily physical accessible, and one way to achieve this is to install cables in conduits

### CAT 5e STP (Shielded Twisted-pair) cable
* Minimizes the risk of EMI and reduce data emanations
* A type of twisted-pair cabling equipped with an additional protective cover that allows for reducing signal interference from outside sources and provides protection against eavesdropping

### Physical Access Control
* Preventive
  * Proximity card reader
  * Smart card reader

### Misc.
* To secure switched and routers?
  1. Set a console port password
  2. Disable unused ports
* Fail-safe
  * a response to a failure will result in the least amount of damage
  * For example, during a power outage, servers connected to the uninterruptible power supply (UPS) will have enough power to shut down properly
* Fail-secure
  * Ensure a component failure (power source) will not compromize security
  * For example, doors will stay locked during power outages
* HVAC (Heating, ventiliation, air conditioning)
* Hot and cold aisles
  * Important for data center cooling
* Proximity cards
  * All access is logged electronically without the need of physical log book or security guard
* Drop celing needs to be removed in a data center room; it can expose potential entry to the room
* Closed-circuit sensor
  * An alram is triggerd if a window is open
* FM-200
  * A fire extinguishing system that is commonly used in data centers and server room to protect the servers from fire
