# Risk Analysis

### Quantitative Risk Analysis
Categorizes risks (or threats) with general (not hard numerical) terms and numerical ranges
* Threat must be identified
* ALE (Annual Loss Expectancy)
  * Calculated using probability values that vary
  * = ARO * SLE
* ARO (Annual Rate of Occurence)
* SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)
* Drawbacks
  * Entails complex calculations
  * Time-consuming than qualitative risk analysis

### Qualitative Risk Analysis
Assesses the likelihood of risks that will imSLApede normal business operations and priotizes risks relative to one another
* Asset validation
* Ranking of potential threats
* Risk should be ranked by likelihood (same for the quantitative risk analysis)

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
* Change Management
  * Example: testing new server configuration changes in a virtual machine lab before applying them to production systems 
* User Rights and Permission Review
  * Example: file server security configuations must be periodically audited
* Incident Management
  * Example: the infected machine must be immediately disconnected from the network

### Risk-related items
* Insurance coverage
* Number of server hard disks

### Asset Management
* Provides countermeasures against:
  * System sprawl
  * Undocumented assets
  * Architecture and design weakness

### Terms
* Risk Management
  * Involves setting aside the funds to account for threats
  * factors
    * Goverment regulations
    * Moving operations to a new building
    * The purchase of a newer firewall solution
* Risk Assessment
  * The identification of threats
* Assets identification
  * The identification of assets (including data) and association of a value with them
* Risk Mitigation
  * Minimizes the impact of perceived risks
* Threat Assessment
  * Determines how an entity can gain access to corporate resources
* Environmental threat assessment
  * Considers natual factors such as floods and earthquakes as well as facility environmental factors such as HVAC and physical security
* Impact Analysis
  * Determines how potential risks will affect business operations
* NDA (Non-disclosure Agreement)
  * A legal contract between the holder of confidential information and another person to whom that information is discloded.
  * It prohibits that other person from disclosing the confidential information to any other party
* BPA (Business partners agreement)

* MoA (Memorandum of Agreement)
  * Takes the MOU a step further once both parties are aware of the details and want to enter an agreement

  * An agreement that oulines how systems to be shared be interfacted
* Embezzlement
  * Theft or misappropriation of funds placed in one's trust or belonging to one's employer
* Risk Transfer
  * Shifts some or all of the burden of risks to a third party
* Risk Avoidance
  * Deciding to invest heavily in a new product for an uncertain market is a gamble. Deciding against it would be classified as risk avoidance
* Risk Acceptance
  * Accepting the potential consequences of a threat
* AUP (Acceptable Use Policy)
  * A type of document stipulating rules of behavior followed by users of computers, networks, and associated resources
