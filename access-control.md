# Access Control
### Access Control Models
* Mandatory Access Model (MAC)
  * Uses security labels to classify data
* Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
  * Leaves control of security to the data owner
  * For example, Linda creates a folder and puts files in the folder, and chooses people who will be shared with the folder contents
* Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
  * Places users into roles that have been granted groups of permissions to perform a job function
* Rule-based Access Control
  * For example, rules defined in network routers
* Attribute-based Access Control
  * An access control using conditions based on attributes such as department, project, and security clearance level
* Time-of-data Access Control

### Trusted OS
* A trusted OS uses a secured OS kernel that supports mandatory access control (MAC), which applies security centrally to adhere with security policies
* Considered too strict for general use and is typically applicable only in high-security environments

### Ports
* FTP -> TCP 20/21
* RDP -> TCP 3389

### Security Controls
* Technical controls
  * Includes amy hardware or software solution using access control in adherence with established security policies
  * Protects computing resources such as files, web sites, databases, and so on
  * Same as logical controls
* Physical controls
  * For example, door locks and fences to protect organizational assets from threats
* Operational control
  * For examples, data backups to ensure business continuity
* Administrative controls
  * Provide a foundation for how a business should be run
* Preventative controls
  * Prevents security breaches, such as the theft as a laptop
* Deterrent controls
  * Discourages malicious or illegal actions but do not necessarily prevents them from happening
* Detective controls
  * Recognizes malicious activity and generates a notification
* Compensating controls
  * Used when other specific security requirements cannot be met but are mitigated through a different type of control
* Corrective controls
  * Mitigates damage once it has occurred, such as disaster recovery plan
