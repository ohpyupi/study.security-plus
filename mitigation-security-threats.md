# Mitigating Security Threats
### Mitigations for Security Threats
* Dictionary attacks
  * Password complexity requirements
* Brute force attacks
  * Account lockout threshold
* ARP poisoning
  * Use 802.1x security
  * Disable unused switch ports
  * Patch OS
  
### Remediation Servers
It checks the status of clients and when a client is found to be unhealthy, it will move the client to an isolated subnet.
Usually in the isolated subnet, clients will be repaired, and after successful repair, it will be moved off of the subnet.

### Security Response
* Alarm
  * It requires a subsequent action when trigerred
* Alert
  * It may or may not require a subsequent action when triggered
  
### Security Coding Guideline
* Error handling
* Input validation
  
### IEEE 802.1x
Ensures the access control for both wired and wireless networks
* Vulnerable to MAC spoofing

### Normalization
A process of organizing data tables and attributes to reduce the data redundancy

### What Secure DevOps entails
* Security Automation
* Continuous Integration
* Immutable Systems
* Infrastructure as Code

### Wrappers
These provide granular control of acess to specific network services
